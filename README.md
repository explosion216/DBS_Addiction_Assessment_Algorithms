# Algorithms for Addiction Assessment via Deep Brain Stimulation

A repository for curating notes, research, and computational algorithms related to the assessment and prediction of addiction severity using Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) data.

## Description

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure involving the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to specific targets in the brain. While traditionally used for movement disorders, its application in treating addiction is a growing field of research.

This repository serves as a knowledge base to explore how data from DBS systems—such as local field potentials (LFPs), stimulation parameters, and patient outcomes—can be leveraged to develop algorithms for assessing, predicting, or understanding the mechanisms of addiction.

## Goals

*   **Centralize Knowledge:** To create a centralized collection of academic papers, notes, and key findings in the field of DBS for addiction.
*   **Develop Algorithms:** To document and develop computational models and algorithms that can analyze DBS data to infer addiction states.
*   **Promote Collaboration:** To provide a platform for researchers, clinicians, and data scientists to collaborate and share insights.
*   **Standardize Methods:** To explore and propose standardized methods for data collection and analysis in this emerging field.

## Contents

This repository will contain a variety of resources, organized into the following directories (proposed structure):

*   **/papers**: Summaries and links to seminal papers and the latest research.
*   **/notes**: Personal and collaborative notes on theoretical concepts, brain targets (e.g., Nucleus Accumbens, Medial Prefrontal Cortex), and clinical observations.
*   **/algorithms**:
    *   `/feature-extraction`: Scripts and methods for extracting relevant features from raw DBS/EEG/fMRI data.
    *   `/biomarker-discovery`: Machine learning models and statistical methods to identify neural biomarkers of craving and relapse.
    *   `/predictive-models`: Algorithms aimed at predicting treatment outcomes or addiction severity based on neural and clinical data.
*   **/datasets**: Information and links to public or simulated datasets that can be used for model development and testing.

## Key Areas of Interest

*   **Signal Processing:** Techniques for cleaning and processing neural signals (LFPs) from DBS electrodes.
*   **Machine Learning:** Application of supervised and unsupervised learning to classify states of craving, withdrawal, and compulsion.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Identifying meaningful features from time-series neural data that correlate with addictive behaviors.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Notes on the ethical implications of using predictive algorithms in clinical practice for addiction.
